I'm Nikolas Samarinas, an undergraduate student in business administration at University of Macedonia in Greece. I have a passion for food and travel.

# My Treasure Hunt Stories
During our treasure hunt in Paris, the city itself became our code to crack.
From the rooftops overlooking the Eiffel Tower, to the shadows of Notre-Dame, and finally on a boat along the Seine, we discovered that innovation and culture share the same DNA: curiosity, connection, and creativity.
Just like low-code development, our journey wasn’t about complexity it was about finding smart pathways, unlocking stories, and building bridges between people, places, and ideas.

# Quote 1:
# Louvre Pyramid
At the glass pyramid of the Louvre, history and modernity met. Just like LightCode, it showed us how timeless knowledge can be reimagined through innovation.

# Seine Cruise
On the waters of the Seine, Paris unfolded like an open book. Each monument whispered stories reminding us that learning flows best when it’s shared.

# Galeries Lafayette Rooftop
From the rooftop of Galeries Lafayette, we saw Paris as a living network of connections. A vision of the future  just like the bridges we build with code.
